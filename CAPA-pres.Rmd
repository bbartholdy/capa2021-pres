## Dental calculus and diet

<!-- and, but, therefore -->

Dental calculus has become a widely used substance for multiple avenues of 
archaeological research

--

(quite successfully)

--

Including dietary research by extraction of plant microremains

However...

---
class: middle

.pull-left[
### What we know

- microremains preserve well in calculus
- they can be extracted from calculus to infer diet
]
.pull-right[
### What we don't know

- mechanism(s) of incorporation (and biases)
- methodological biases of extraction methods
- how diet affects calculus growth
- and a whole lot more...
]

---
class: middle, center, inverse

## So what are we going to do about it?

Presenting an oral biofilm model to grow and 'feed' dental calculus in a
highly controlled setting.

---
class: middle

## An oral what-now?

Biofilm: Communities of microbial cells within extracellular polymers.

Biofilm model: growing a biofilm in (or moving to) a lab for analysis.

--

Popular in clinical studies
- study the behaviour of microbiota in biofilms

- the affect of diet on dental disease, 

- and the effect of various treatments on (opportunistic) pathogens.

---
class: middle

## Calculus models

Also known as *in vitro* dental calculus

Common until the 90s, 

then focus shifted to short-term biofilm models for testing
treatments (caries, periodontitis, etc.)

Lack of interest from dental research since then

---

## Types of biofilm models

.pull-left[
**Simple**

- agar plate
- multiplate

**Complex**

- constant depth film fermenter
- modified robbins device
- artificial mouth

]

.pull-right[

- multiwell plate with suspended substrata
  - polypropylene 24 deepwell plate with lid
- substrata suspended vertically for active attachment
- high throughput model
- consistent treatment(s) across all samples
]

---
class: middle

## Protocol

.pull-left[
- inoculated with whole saliva
- incubated for 25 days (36&deg;C, 30 rpm)
- sucrose for bacterial growth
- wheat and potato treatments
- increase mineralisation with CPMU
- extraction (EDTA) and quantification of starches

## Goal

To test fundamental aspects of dental calculus analysis by using the oral biofilm model as a proxy.

Incorporation is so low it's not visible in the plot

so here's a table

```
.smaller[Mean percentage of starches from solutions extracted from the calculus.]

class: middle

.pull-left[
```{r size-bias-pl-2, out.width="95%"}

.pull-right[
### Size bias

Small (<10 $\mu$m) and medium (10-20 $\mu$m) starches over-represented

Large (>20 $\mu$m) starches under-represented
  - especially potato

]

---
class: middle

## What does this mean?

--

Replication is needed before confirming anything

--

But...

--

The low recovery rate of starch granules in fossil dental calculus likely starts *in vivo*

--

- further compounded by diagenesis

--

And the size of granules matters

--

- large-granule producers are under-represented

---
class: middle

## Starch incorporation

.pull-left[
```{r starch-incorp-fig, fig.cap="DISCLAIMER: this is an educated guess..."}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/starch_incorporation.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
`r emo::ji("left arrow")` Based on our results it may look something like this

But no one really seems to know <!--r emo::ji("shrug")`-->
]

---
class: middle

## Kinks in the model

--

No amylase (a beneficial side-effect?)

--

Deposits are not particularly large (ca. 1-10 $\mu$g)

--

Extrapolation of starch counts likely not 100% accurate

--

Starch delivery system is not perfect
- substrata are transferred to plate with starch solutions
- rpm is increased to double speed

---
class: middle

## Potential of the model

**Methods testing**
  
- extraction using various dissolution agents (e.g. EDTA and HCl)
- DNA and protein extraction and identification biases

--
  
**Training extraction and identification of starches (and other remains)**

- no need to use finite archaeological remains
- no ethical considerations

--

**High degree of control over multiple factors**

- dietary input
- bacterial composition (sort of...)

---
class: middle

## Summary

--

Interpretation of starches extracted from dental calculus is tricky

--

- very little is actually incorporated

--

- highly variable from sample to sample

--

- size affects likelihood of incorporation

--

We still know very little, but... 

--

our model can supplement archaeological studies

--

...and help us learn a little more
